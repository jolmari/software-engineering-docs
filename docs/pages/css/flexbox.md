## Cheatsheet - Aligning content

- `justify-content` is set on the container and distributes the elements along the main axis (for `flex-direction: row`, that is the horizontal axis)
- `align-items` is also set on the container and distributes the elements along the cross axis (for `flex-direction: row`, that is the vertical axis)
- `justify-items` has no effect on a flex-container, itâ€™s used to distribute the elements in a grid container along the main axis within their cells
- `align-content` only applies when a flex-container has multiple rows (when `flex-wrap` is set to `wrap` ), and defines how the rows of elements are distributed along the cross-axis
