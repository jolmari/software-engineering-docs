# Introduction
Kured (KUbernetes REboot Daemon) is a Kubernetes **daemonset** that performs safe automatic node reboots when the need to do so is indicated by the package management system of the underlying OS.

- Watches for the presence of a reboot sentinel file e.g.Â `/var/run/reboot-required`Â or the successful run of a sentinel command.
- Utilises a lock in the API server to ensure only one node reboots at a time
- Optionally defers reboots in the presence of active Prometheus alerts or selected pods
- Cordons & drains worker nodes before reboot, uncordoning them after
