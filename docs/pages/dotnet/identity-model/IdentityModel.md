# Introduction
IdentityModel is a .NET library for claims-based identity, OAuth 2.0 and [[openid-connect | OpenId Connect]].

It provides an object model to interact with the endpoints defined in the various OAuth and [[openid-connect | OpenId Connect]] specifications in the form of:
- types to represent the requests and responses
- extension methods to invoke requests
- constants defined in the specifications, such as standard scope, claim, and parameter names
- other convenience methods for performing common identity related operations
