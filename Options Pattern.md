# Snapshot options
UsingÂ [IOptionsSnapshot](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.options.ioptionssnapshot-1):
- Options are computed once per request when accessed and cached for the lifetime of the request.
- May incur a significant performance penalty because it's aÂ [Scoped service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection#scoped)Â and is recomputed per request. For more information, seeÂ [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/53793)Â andÂ [Improve the performance of configuration binding](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/36130).
- Changes to the configuration are read after the app starts when using configuration providers that support reading updated configuration values.
